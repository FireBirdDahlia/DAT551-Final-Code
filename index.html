            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Dubai is a city known for its futuristic skyline and luxurious lifestyle, but beneath 
                its modern appearance lies a rich history often overlooked. Beginning as a modest 
                fishing and pearl-diving village, Dubai's connection to the sea and trade shaped 
                its early development. Through centuries of cultural exchanges and bold leadership, 
                it transformed from these humble beginnings into a global hub for commerce and tourism,
                demonstrating how a city can evolve while still preserving its heritage.

            <h1>Origins of Dubai</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="page">
            <p>The history of Dubai dates back to the early Minoan era. Formerly, the area that 
                is Dubai now lies on was a huge mangrove swamp. That swamp had dried out and was 
                inhabited by 3000 BCE. The first people to dwell in the region are said to have been 
                nomadic cattle herders during the Bronze Age.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>It wasn't until 2500 BCE that they successfully developed a date palm plantation, 
                marking the earliest instance of agricultural use at the location. The region that 
                is now called Jumeirah was a caravan station on the trade route that connected Oman 
                with modern-day Iraq in the fifth century CE.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>The main sources of income at the time were fishing, pearl diving, boat building, and
                housing and feeding traders who came through to sell textiles, gold, and spices. Today,
                the local souks offer them as perfect souvenirs to take back home.

        <div class="page">
            <h1>1833</h1>
            <p>1833 was a milestone year in Dubaiâ€™s history, when Maktoum bin Butti of the Bani Yas 
                tribe led his people to the Shindagha Peninsula at the mouth of Dubai Creek. He settled
                Â there and declared the town's independence. From that point on, Dubai was recognized as 
                an independent settlement, but still essentially a fishing community.
            </p>
            <h1>1894</h1>
            <p>Dubai started to prosper greatly under the Al Maktoum leadership. Due to the ideal business 
                conditions, many foreign workers, particularly those from Pakistan and India, were drawn to
                the city in 1894 when new laws exempting expatriates from paying taxes were introduced.

            <h1>1960</h1>
            <p>The former ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, led the majority of the 
                transformation of the city from this point on. Under his vision for a great city, 
                the construction forÂ Dubai International Airport (DXB Airport) began.Â Sheikh Rashid
                carried out his grand plan later that year, building the Dubai Creek to allow trading 
                shipsÂ to sail in.

            <h1>1966</h1>
            <p>It was in 1966 when Dubai hit a jackpot â€” they found oil. Though the discovery 
                jumpstarted incredible projects, the oil reserves were thought to be rather small 
                by Middle Eastern standards at the time. The limited resource was still, however, 
                considered a blessing for the city. Rather than viewing oil as a limitless source of 
                income, Sheikh Rashid began investing the profits into urban development. His goal was 
                to build a city whose economy would not be reliant on oil.

                At 39 stories and 149 meters high, it was the tallest building in Dubai at the time and 
                served as a gathering place for people from neighboring countries to engage in business
